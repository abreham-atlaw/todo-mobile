        widgets: Contains UI components specific to authentication.

1.2 core

This folder represents the core functionality of the Flutter project.

    1.2.1 application: Business logic layer, including BLoCs for home, todo list, and todo creation.
        blocs: Contains BLoCs for home, list todos, and write todo.
        events: Defines events related to home, list todos, and write todo.
        forms: Includes form classes for creating todos.
        states: Holds state classes for home, list todos, and write todo.

    1.2.2 data: Manages entities and communicates with the backend.
        models: Contains models such as category and todo.
        repositories: Implements operations related to appwrite, categories, and todos.
        serializers: Handles serialization for category and todo data.

    1.2.3 presentation: Handles UI rendering using Flutter widgets.
        screens: Includes Flutter screens for the base, home, list todos, splash, and write todo.
        widgets: Contains UI components like bottom navigation bar and various widgets for categories and todos.

2. lib/common
   2.1 async_bloc

Reusable components for handling asynchronous operations and state management.

    Contains classes for AsyncBlocs, AsyncEvents, AsyncStates, and error handling.

2.2 forms

Utilities and exceptions related to form handling.

    Includes exceptions and base classes for forms and fields.

2.3 models

Generic model class for data representation.
2.4 serializers

Generic serialization classes for handling data serialization.
2.5 utils

Various utility classes for file storage, random generation, and routing.
2.6 widgets

Reusable UI components.

    buttons: Custom button widgets.
    containers: Custom container widgets.
    forms: Custom form-related widgets.
    navigation: Navigation-related widgets.
    screens: Generic screen widgets.
    text: Text-related widgets.

3. configs

Configuration files for content, data, and UI settings.
4. di

Dependency injection configuration file for core providers.
5. main.dart

Entry point for the Flutter application.
6. router.dart

File responsible for handling routing within the application.

The file structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the project modular, maintainable, and scalable. The three-layer architecture facilitates efficient communication between data, application, and presentation layers for each feature. Reusable components in the common folder enhance code reusability across different parts of the application.
Running the Project Locally
Prerequisites:

    Install Flutter: Follow the official Flutter installation guide to set up Flutter on your machine.

    Install Dart: Flutter requires the Dart SDK. You can download it from the Dart SDK page.

    Ensure your IDE is set up: You can use Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, or Android Studio with the Flutter and Dart plugins installed.

Steps to Run the Flutter Project Locally:

    Clone the Repository:
    Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the project repository:

    bash

git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to Project Directory:
Change your working directory to the project's root folder:

bash

cd <project_directory>

Install Dependencies:
Run the following command to fetch and install the project dependencies:

bash

flutter pub get

Run the Application:
Connect your device (physical device or emulator) to your machine. Ensure USB debugging is enabled for Android devices.

Run the application using the following command:

bash

    flutter run

    This command builds and installs the Flutter app on the connected device. If you have multiple devices connected, Flutter will prompt you to choose the target device.

    View the App:
    Once the build process is complete, you should see the Flutter app running on your device. If it's the first run, it might take a bit longer as Flutter sets up the necessary files.

Congratulations! You have successfully run the Flutter project locally. You can now interact with the app on your device as you would with any Flutter application.

Remember that Flutter supports hot reload, so you can make changes to the code, save, and see the updates almost instantly without restarting the entire application.
